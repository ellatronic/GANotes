# OPENING (10 mins)
What is `OAuth`? What is the problem? Users donâ€™t want to give up their Facebook passwords with good reason but authentication is required in order to access their data (i.e., name or profile picture).


## PRACTICE PROBLEM

Please find an app that uses OAuth 2.0 & a personal use case.

## Definition 

- OAuth, which is pronounced "oh-auth," stands for Open Authorization. 
- OAuth is a standard for authentication based on tokens. 
- token-based authentication allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Google, Facebook, etc., without exposing the end user's password
- OAuth 1.0 
- OAuth 2.0 differs from 1.0 in that it provides specific authorization work flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices. 

## Authentication

These three steps cover authentication with OAuth 2.0.

- the first step : API key 
- the second step : pass the API key to the API server
- the third step : receive the access token 

An example is Instagram. You register your app at the API server; the API server hands you a key. You send the key in a POST request to the API server. The API server receives the POST request's API key; the API server returns an access token with which to access its data like the latest posts. 


# Write Pair Share - (2 mins)

Engage in a mock OAuth 2.0 authentication session. 
 

# INTRODUCTION: Firebase 

Firebase does the heavy lifting for us. 

## OAuth

1. Install the Firebase SDK
2. Open the Firebase console. 
3. Add a new app in the console. 
4. Create a single view Xcode project. 
5. In the Xcode project's directory run `pod init`.
6. Run `nano Podfile`. 
7. Under the target for the name of the Xcode project's target add: `pod 'Firebase/Auth'`.
8. Run `pod install`
5. Open the `.xcworkspace` file. 
6. In the `AppDelegate` write `import Firebase` to add the library to the `AppDelegate`. 
7. In the method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` add `FIRApp.configure()`, which sets up Firebase's initial configuration for the iOS app. 
8. In the custom sublcass of `UIViewController` called `ViewController` let's create a property in the following way: `private var _authHandle: FIRAuthStateDidChangeListenerHandle!`. The handler will serve as a reference for the state changes that authentication trigger. 
9. If there is no `viewWillAppear`, simply start typing
 `viewWillAppear` to add the listener:  
 
 ``` 
 _authHandle = FIRAuth.auth()?.addStateDidChangeListener({ (auth: FIRAuth, user: FIRUser?) in
            if user != nil {
                print(" CONFIGURATION : The user is being printed as: \(user?.email!)")
                print(" CONFIGURATION : The user is being printed as: \(user?.email!)")
                print(" CONFIGURATION : The user is being printed as: \(user?.email!)")
            }
        })
```
10. Detach the handler in `viewWillDisappear` with `FIRAuth.auth()?.removeStateDidChangeListener(handle!)`.

10. Configure the UI in `Main.storyboard` such that two instances `UILabel` as `emailLoginTextField` & `passwordLoginTextField` & two instances of `UIButton` as an action called `didTapCreateLogin` & `didTapEmailLogin`
11. Configure `didTapCreateLogin` with the following code: 

``` 
@IBAction func didTapCreateLogin(_ sender: Any) {
        
        FIRAuth.auth()?.signIn(withEmail: emailLoginTextField.text!, password: passwordLoginTextField.text!) {
        (user, error) in
        
            if user != nil && error == nil {
                
                print("LOGIN : The user is logged in now as \(user?.email!)")
                print("LOGIN : The user is logged in now as \(user?.email!)")
                print("LOGIN : The user is logged in now as \(user?.email!)")
            } else {
                print("Here is the error: \(error)")
                print("Here is the user: \(user)")
            }
        }
    }
    
```
12.
 Configure `didTapEmailLogin` with the following code: 

```
@IBAction func signup(_ sender: Any) {
        
        
        let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Signup", message: "Sign up", preferredStyle: .alert)
        
        let saveAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Save", style: .default) { action in
            let emailField = alert.textFields![0]
            let passwordField = alert.textFields![1]
            
            
            FIRAuth.auth()?.createUser(withEmail: emailLoginTextField.text!, password: passwordLoginTextField.text!) { (user, error) in
                
                FIRAuth.auth()!.signIn(withEmail: self.eemailLoginTextField.text!, password: self.passwordLoginTextField.text!)
            }
            
        }
        
      let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel)
        
        alert.addTextField { textEmail in
            textEmail.placeholder = "Enter your email"
        }
        
        alert.addTextField { textPassword in
            textPassword.isSecureTextEntry = true
            textPassword.placeholder = "Enter your password"
        }
        
       alert.addAction(saveAction)
       alert.addAction(cancelAction)
        
       present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
        
    }

```

13. In an `extension` beyond the scope of the custom subclass of `UIViewController` called `ViewController` add the following code: 

```
extension ViewController: UITextFieldDelegate {
    
    func textFieldShouldReturn(_ textField: UITextField) -> Bool {
        if textField == emailLoginTextField {
            emailLoginTextField.becomeFirstResponder()
        }
        if textField == passwordLoginTextField {
            passwordLoginTextField.resignFirstResponder()
        }
        
        return true
    }
    
}

```

14.
Go to the Firebase console. Add an app. Use the Xcode project's bundle identifer. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` & add it to the Xcode project.

15.
<b>Run the project!</b>


16.
Print out the user's name. 

# INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

Implement OAuth 2.0 in an application with Firebase. 

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

* Read through the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/start)

* Create a new single view application.

* Print out the name of the current user after authentication.

* Compare your app with Firebase's own sample code.

# CONCLUSION (5 mins)

## CHECK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING: WRITE-SHARE

*Write down what you think is the purpose of a OAuth 2.0 is.*

## TAKEAWAYS

* OAuth 2.0 is standard authorization framework that enables  a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP / HTTPS service. 

* Integrating with a third party SDK often solves the problem of OAuth.
