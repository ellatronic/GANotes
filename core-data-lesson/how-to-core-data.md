# How To: Core Data üôåüòÅ



## Managed Object Model

This describes the way Core Data is modeled on the disk

+ Create a new project, and check the Core Data option! 
+ Check out the data model file that was created automatically for you
	+ `APP_NAME.xcdatamodeld`
+ Now for some vocabulary:
	+ **Entity**: This is a class definition in Core Data
	+ **Attribute**: Some information attached to a particular Entity
	+ **Relationship**: This is a link between multiple entities 
+ **To Add an Entity**:
	+ Click the add Entity button
	+ Add the attributes/relationships necessary for that given entity

### NSManagedObjectModel

The actual data model for your application. This model is represented by the `.xcdatamodeld` file.

### NSManagedObjectContext

You need this class before you save or retrieve data from Core Data. It's a workpad that will work with the Core Data Object and creates, reads, updates, and deletes model objects.

### NSPersistentContainer

Keeps a reference to the NSManagedObjectModel. Initialized automatically when you check the Core Data option when creating a new project. This class will have a property that is the default `NSManagedObjectContext`.

### NSManagedObject

This is the actual object that you store in Core Data. This refers to your Entity object that you created earlier.

### NSFetchRequest

Responsible for fetching data from Core Data. Fetch Requests are very powerful. You can use them to filter entities by attributes or criteria!
